# Binary and Decimal

Author a method based on the binary to decimal algorithm you devised in class.

## Exercises

Write a method named `binary_to_decimal` that receives as input parameter an array of size 8. The array is randomly filled with 0’s and 1’s. Assuming that the array represents an eight bit binary number with the most significant bit at index 0 and the least significant bit at index 7, calculate the decimal value for this binary number using the algorithm you devised in class. Return the decimal value.

**Note:** Do not use Ruby functions. You may use `.length` method on the array and retrieve values at a particular index in the array. Author using the algorithm you devised in class.

You may however write your own versions of these methods

**Due Date**  This assignment is due **Tuesday Sept 15th 7pm**

You can test your program by running `rake` from the command line and it will run your method against a set of automated tests.

## Optional

Add a `decimal_to_binary` method which converts a decimal number received as a parameter into an array of binary digits.  Then write 3 tests for the method.
